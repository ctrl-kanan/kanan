# Kanan
A program designed to ease your daily activities, coded in Nim.

# What is _kanan_?
### A little bit of detail
As stated in the description, Kanan is
- A simple program that doesn't require troubleshooting
- Your best friend for tricky issues
- A CLI joker

Kanan is also my personal project I've made, replacing _markustools_.

# How do I install Kanan?
You can **currently** 
- Install Kanan via the AUR with a package manager,
- or **hopefully** install Kanan with chocolatey for **Windows**.
or if you **don't use** Arch Linux, you can build it by scratch.

## Steps for building by scratch (Linux ONLY!)
- Change directory to source
- Run **./makeinstall** (it will install dependancies, move markustools to the binaries folder, and finish up) Simple!

# Why did I make Kanan?
I made Kanan as a replacement for _markustools_. Here's why: 
- Faster
- More compatible
- Can be interactive (like _markustools_), but **also take in parameters**!

Thanks for reading!
